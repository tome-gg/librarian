# Data Definitions

## 1. Mental models

These are the synthesized, generalized learning tools for problem solving.

## 2. Contexts

These are the scenario-based content, heavily depending on some frame, perspective, or objective.

### Problems

Problem-based contexts describe a problem or issue, but does not have a clear objective.

### Goals

Goal-based contexts defines some clearly articulated direction or objective to be achieved.

### Scenarios

Scenarios are unclassified- this may be a problem, a goal, or both.

## 3. Flashcards

Flash card learning's primary objective is improving memory and recall.

### Manual

Content can be manually submitted by manually entering content either on tome.gg or on Github.

### Automated (templates)

Automated content can be produced by defining templates. Templating must have its own syntax and algorithm defined.

## 4. Examinations

Examinations allow the user to read some question and have multiple choice answers to pick from.

### Manual

Content can be manually submitted by manually entering content either on tome.gg or on Github.

### Automated (templates)

Automated content can be produced by defining templates. Templating must have its own syntax and algorithm defined.

## 5. Journals

### Growth journal

Growth journals are primarily written by the learner/student, but can be annotated by a mentor or a direct supervisor. Once you leave your organization, you can revoke access to your mentor or direct supervisor, and still own your growth journal.

### DSU updates

Ideally this is separated into a different repository, so that your daily stand-up notes are owned by you- that way you have a way to demonstrate your articulation and communication skills when you move from different companies.
